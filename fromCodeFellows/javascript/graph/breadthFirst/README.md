# Challenge Summary
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge Description
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)

# Challenge Summary
Implement a depth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time: O(v+e)
Big O Space: O(d)
