# Challenge Summary
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called `FizzBuzzTree` which takes a k-ary tree as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
We whiteboarded for 45 minutes per instructor instructions. Big O for space is O(n * 2). Big O for time is O(n * 2h).
