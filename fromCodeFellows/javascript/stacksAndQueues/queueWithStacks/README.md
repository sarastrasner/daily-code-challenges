# Challenge Summary
Implement a Queue using two Stacks

## Challenge Description
Create a `PseudoQueue` class without using an existing Queue. Create your class with the following methods:
- `enqueue(value)` which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- `dequeue()` which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
My partners and I whiteboarded for an hour, and didn't get as far ad we'd hoped to. We were contemplatng how to integrate some of the other methods into our solution and ran out of time.
